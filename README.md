# Setting Up a Regional External Load Balancer on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Terraform

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a regional external load balancer on GCP using Terraform. The load balancer will route traffic to a Cloud Run service, providing scalable and reliable HTTP(S) load balancing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
- `gcloud` CLI installed and configured.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- A GCP project with billing enabled.
- A service account with the necessary permissions to manage GCP resources.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Configure Terraform Provider

Set up the Terraform provider for Google Cloud:

###STEP 2
### Define the necessary variables in a `variables.tf` file:



Step 3: Create Network and Subnet
Create a VPC network and a subnetwork in your network.tf file:

Step 4: Create Cloud Run Service
Deploy a Cloud Run service in your main.tf file (assuming you have a Docker image):

Step 5: Create Backend Service
Create a regional backend service that points to the Cloud Run service in your main.tf file:

Step 6: Create URL Map
Create a URL map to route requests to the backend service in your main.tf file:

Step 7: Create HTTPS Proxy
Create a regional HTTPS proxy to route requests through HTTPS in your main.tf file:

Step 8: Create Forwarding Rule
Create a regional forwarding rule to route incoming traffic to the HTTPS proxy in your main.tf file:

Step 9: Configure SSL Certificate
Configure an SSL certificate to secure the load balancer in your main.tf file:

Step 10: Configure Firewall Rules
Create firewall rules to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in your main.tf file:

Conculsion
By following the steps outlined above, you have successfully created a regional external load balancer on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform. The load balancer routes traffic to a Cloud Run service, secured with an SSL certificate, ensuring secure and efficient handling of HTTP(S) traffic.
